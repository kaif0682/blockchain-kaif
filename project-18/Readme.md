# Real Estate Tokenizer Smart Contract

## Vision

The Real Estate Tokenizer project aims to create a decentralized platform for fractional ownership of real estate properties. By tokenizing real estate, property owners can divide their property into shares, which investors can purchase. This approach makes real estate investment more accessible, providing an opportunity for investors to own a portion of valuable properties while ensuring transparency and traceability through blockchain technology.

## Features

- **Tokenize Property**: Property owners can tokenize their real estate by dividing it into shares and specifying rental income per share.
- **Purchase Shares**: Investors can purchase shares of tokenized properties, gaining partial ownership and benefiting from rental income.
- **Rental Income per Share**: Each share represents a portion of the rental income generated by the property, enabling investors to earn income based on their ownership.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x6cb21df530ac047e3114dbb151cbebe1fb85aef8108a0feeae0f824b564c0934`

## How It Works

1. **Tokenize Property**:

   - Property owners call the `tokenize_property` function to tokenize their real estate property.
   - The function takes parameters such as the property name, total number of shares, and rental income per share, and stores the information on the blockchain.
   - The property is represented as `PropertyToken`, including the available shares and rental income details.

2. **Purchase Shares**:
   - Investors can call the `purchase_shares` function to buy shares of a tokenized property.
   - The function checks if there are enough available shares and then updates the available share count.
   - Payment handling and share transfer processes are assumed to be managed off-chain.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Payment Handling**: Integrate payment logic to enable secure, on-chain purchase transactions between investors and property owners.
- **Dividend Distribution**: Implement automatic rental income distribution to investors based on their shareholding.
- **Secondary Market**: Develop a secondary market to enable investors to buy and sell property shares with other investors.
- **Property Valuation Updates**: Add functionality for updating property valuation and share pricing to reflect market changes.
- **Governance Mechanism**: Allow shareholders to participate in decision-making processes related to property management, such as maintenance or rental rate adjustments.
- **Token Standards and NFT Integration**: Represent property shares as NFTs to facilitate easy transfer and ownership verification.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, property owners can tokenize their properties, and investors can purchase shares through the smart contract functions.
